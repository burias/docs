3. Let's name it Bullet Journal and add a description.

> "Though it does require a journal, Bullet JournalÂ® is a methodology. It's best described as a mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity system. It's designed to help you organize your what while you remain mindful of your why. The goal of the Bullet Journal is to help its practitioners (Bullet Journalists) live intentional lives, ones that are both productive and meaningful."
